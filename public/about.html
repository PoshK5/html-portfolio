<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Portia Khanyile is a devoted, loving, mother of 5, with the dream of completing her studies on Web development through Udemy. She is a graduate in Building, having studied at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, her previous job in the construction field, she was assigned as the site's Junior Quantity Surveyor at one the company's biggest projects at the University of Stellenbosch in Cape Town. After being retrenched and not finding employment for almost two years, she then moved to another province, all in the hope of seeking for greener pastures. She was then appointed at a private school as a first grade teacher, and she worked there for 2 years and 3 months. She decided to stay at home and take care of her then 6 month old baby, after the sudden clousure of the pre-school he attended.
  This decision only resulted on a heavy strain on the financial aspect for her family, as her husband was the only one pulling the weight.

<p>After much consideration, knocking on doors with not much success, she weighed her options between leaving her family and moving back to Cape Town and seek for a job or come up with a sustainable plan to take care of her family. Having an interest in computers and how they work, she took a plunge in Web development and sacrified the little her family had, purchased the Full Stack Web development course and has not looked back.</p>

<p>Her only dream and aspiration is to make it in life, to be able provide a better life for her children. She dreams of opening her own Coding Academy one day, to empower the young children within her community. With the resilience and enthusiasm she has, nothing shall be impossible. She is on a journey of discovering herself and challenging her God given wisdom, with the hope of also making it in life.</p>
